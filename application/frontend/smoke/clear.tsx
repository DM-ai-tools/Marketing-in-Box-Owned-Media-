/* Clearing a phase, and the warning in front of every deletion. Not shipped — see smoke/README.md.
 *
 * The thing worth pinning here is the **scope**. A chat carries both legs, and the ordinary shape of
 * the work is a finished Phase 1 run with a Phase 2 leg on top of it — so "clear" has to mean the
 * leg on screen and nothing else. A version of this that cleared the chat would look right in every
 * screenshot and would quietly throw away fifteen approved assets the moment somebody restarted
 * their sub-service. Every assertion under "what clearing resets" is about that boundary.
 *
 * Three halves, for the three ways it can go wrong:
 *
 *   - `selectCanClearPhase` / `selectOtherPhaseHasWork` are pure functions, so they are called
 *     directly. They decide whether the control appears at all and what it is allowed to call
 *     itself — a button reading "Clear chat" that clears one phase is the mislabel this file exists
 *     to prevent.
 *   - `clearPhase` is called against a seeded store and its result asserted, leg by leg.
 *   - the render checks prove the control is there, carries the right label, and only asks on the
 *     first click.
 *
 * The dialog's own copy is local component state and is not reachable from a first paint, so the
 * `ConfirmDialog` assertions below go through `ChatDeleteDialog`, which is store-driven.
 *
 * Network is stubbed off: clearing a leg restarts it, and restarting reaches for the run and its
 * context. This file is about what the store holds the moment the clear lands, which `clearPhase`
 * sets synchronously before any of that.
