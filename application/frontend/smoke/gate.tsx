/* The start-at-a-stage gate: the readiness card and the "Start here" affordance on the pipeline.
 * Not shipped — see smoke/README.md.
 *
 * What is worth proving in a render check here is not the layout but the *offers*. Every wrong
 * answer this card can give sends an operator to do work they do not need to do, or hides work they
 * do:
 *
 *   - offering to supply a competitor list, which the stage's own scan produces — there is no stage
 *     to run for it and nothing to paste,
 *   - reporting a document as missing when the run inherited it from its Phase 1 parent,
 *   - calling a stage blocked over `unresolved_context_key`, which is a question and not a missing
 *     document, and
 *   - naming the whole four-asset chain to run when the run is one paste away.
 *
 * The readiness payloads below are the shapes `GET /runs/{id}/readiness/{asset}` really returns;
 * `tests/test_standalone_runs.py` is what pins that they are.
 *
 * The second half covers the other way into this: a run whose client has no page for the ICP's
 * service at all, where the CRO stage offers build-from-scratch or a skip to the page build.
