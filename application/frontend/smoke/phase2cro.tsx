/* Phase 2's CRO stage — the stage that makes the phase self-sufficient. Not shipped; see
 * smoke/README.md.
 *
 * The Pillar Page prompt is a design replicator with no service input of any kind: it lays out
 * whatever copy it is handed, so that copy *is* the subject of the page. While Phase 2 had no CRO
 * stage, that copy could only be the parent Phase 1 run's rewrite of the client's headline service —
 * so a run pointed at "Meta Ads" came back a Social Media Marketing page — or a document the
 * operator wrote themselves and pasted in.
 *
 * What is worth proving here is not that the stage exists but that it does not merely move the work.
 * The value of this stage is almost entirely in what it does *not* ask: every question it asks is one
 * the operator already answered once during Phase 1. So the intake walk is run end to end against a
 * realistic inherited run, and the questions that remain are named exactly. If that list grows, this
 * fails and says what joined it.
