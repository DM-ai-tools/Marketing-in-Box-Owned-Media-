/* The card path, rendered with the real store. Not shipped — deleted after the check runs.
 *
 * `smoke.tsx` covers the new presentation components in isolation. This is the higher-risk half:
 * `GenerationCard` and `ActionRow` were edited in place inside a 700-line file that drives a
 * 3,300-line store, and the requirement was that the core working of the app not regress. So the
 * real `GenerationStream` is mounted against a seeded store and every state a generation can be in
 * is asserted — streaming, finished, saved, superseded, interrupted, failed, refining.
 *
 * Server rendering means effects never run, so this proves the *first paint* of each state. What it
 * cannot prove is a click handler firing; those are asserted structurally instead (the button
 * exists, is enabled or disabled correctly, and carries the right label). */

/** Seed only what the transcript reads, and render it.

 * Seeding goes into the *initial state object*, which needs explaining. zustand v5 passes
 * `getInitialState` as `useSyncExternalStore`'s **server** snapshot (`zustand/react.js`), so a
 * server render deliberately reads the state as created and ignores every later `setState` — that
 * is what keeps a real SSR page hydration-stable, and it is correct behaviour rather than a bug.
 *
 * Reassigning `usePipelineStore.getInitialState` does not help either: `create` closes over the
 * original api object and `Object.assign`s a *copy* onto the hook, so the copy is not the function
 * the hook calls. What does work is mutating the object that function returns, which is the same
 * reference every time.
 *
 * `setState` is still called so `getState()` and the server snapshot agree. Nothing in `src/` is
 * patched by any of this.
