/** The Plan of Action, as a tree.
 *
 * Why parse rather than ask the model for a diagram
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * `Plan-of-Action-Architect-Prompt.md` already offers an "OPTIONAL PART 2 — TREE-VIEW HTML
 * VISUALISATION" — a self-contained interactive HTML file it will build *if requested*. Using that
 * would mean the diagram is regenerated from scratch on every run: a different layout each time, a
 * few thousand output tokens each time, and no guarantee the markup is even valid, on the one asset
 * whose whole point is to be navigable. So the plan's *text* stays the deliverable and the diagram
 * is derived from it here — same document, same tree, every time, at no token cost.
 *
 * What the plan's shape actually is
 * ---------------------------------
 * Its declared output format is ten numbered top-level sections (Executive Summary, Current State,
 * Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Total Asset Summary, Funnel Overview, Lead Magnet Master List,
 * Sub-Service Priority Ranking, Monthly Execution Timeline). Underneath, three shapes recur:
 *
 *   * **Phase 1** lists eight numbered assets.
 *   * **Phase 2** repeats a fixed per-sub-service schema, and its heading is `## [N]. [Name]` —
 *     the same `N.` form the top-level sections use. That collision is the reason this module
 *     cannot simply split on numbers: it has to read *relative* depth.
 *   * **Phase 3** uses lettered categories, `A.` through `H.`, plus a funnels group.
 *
 * How depth is decided
 * --------------------
 * Every heading-like line is given a raw level, and the raw levels are then *normalised* — the
 * distinct levels a document actually used are mapped onto 1, 2, 3… in order. A run that writes
 * `#` then `###` with no `##` in between nests identically to one that writes `#` then `##`, which
 * matters because these documents are generated and their heading discipline varies.
 *
 * Nothing is dropped. Every line of the plan lands in some node's `body`, and the caller can always
 * fall back to the plain document — see `PlanMindMap`, where that is a visible switch rather than
 * an error path.
