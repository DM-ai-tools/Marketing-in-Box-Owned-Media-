/** Reading one *entry* out of a map-shaped context value.
 *
 * Almost every context key names a whole document — the ICP, the CRO rewrite, the funnel — and a
 * field that reads it wants all of it. A few name one entry of a map an upstream stage resolved:
 * `cro_terminology_map`'s three word choices, which later stages read one at a time through
 * `ctx(..., { sub_key })` in `data/assetCatalog.ts`.
 *
 * The Context Store only ever holds the producing stage's document, so the entry has to be read
 * back out of it. Until it was, `sub_key` was decorative: every one of those fields resolved to the
 * entire producing document, which meant the Offers stage received the whole ~80KB CRO rewrite
 * four times over (once legitimately as its CRO framework input, three more times in fields whose
 * expected answer is a single word like "homeowner"). That inflated the stage's prompt to ~131k
 * input tokens and told the Value Ladder prompt that the buyer's word *was* an 80KB document.
 */

/** Where each sub-key is written inside its producing document, in that document's own words.
 *
 * The CRO rewrite states the whole map in one "Terminology map" / "Resolved terminology" row of its
 * PART 0 table — see the Step 0 instruction in
 * `assets/Prompts/Master_Prompt_Universal_Page_Rewrite_v1.md`, which asks for "the resolved
 * terminology you will use throughout (reader, offer unit, commitment step, …)" — so each entry is
 * found by its own label. Three phrasings of each are matched, because all three occur in real
 * output: the placeholder tokens the injected `CRO_Framework_Universal_v1.md` defines (`{BUYER}`,
 * `{OFFER_UNIT}`, `{ENGAGEMENT}`), the plain words the Step 0 instruction uses, and the INPUTS
 * block's own field labels, which a rewrite that restates its inputs verbatim echoes instead. */
