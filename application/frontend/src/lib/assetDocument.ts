/** Reading the structure a stage's output already has.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Every large prompt in `assets/Prompts/` ends by declaring a labelled output format. The CRO
 * rewrite closes with "Deliver in four labelled parts: PART 0 — MODE RESOLUTION TABLE / PART 1 —
 * CRO AUDIT REPORT / PART 2 — REWRITTEN PAGE / PART 3 — IMPLEMENTATION PACK". Pillar Page declares
 * PART 1-4. The blog prompt declares `PART 1 — The Set Plan` and then one `## Blog N — [Title]`
 * block per post. Webinar runs STEP 1-8 per package.
 *
 * The transcript threw all of it away: `GenerationCard` handed the whole document to one
 * `<Markdown>`, always expanded, in a flat list of fifteen stages. With `blog`, `lead_magnet` and
 * `webinar` configured at 128k output tokens, one card could be ten thousand words of unbroken
 * scroll.
 *
 * So this reads the headings back out and the card becomes an outline. Nothing is summarised and
 * nothing is dropped — this is a *reading* change, not a content change.
 *
 * The precedent is `htmlBlocks.ts`, which already does exactly this for one case: it lifts a fenced
 * ```html block out of the Markdown and hands it to a real renderer, leaving the surrounding prose
 * untouched. Same idea, generalised to the document's own sections.
 *
 * Losslessness
 * ------------
 * Two guarantees, and both are load-bearing because this sits between the operator and a
 * deliverable they are about to send to a client:
 *
 *   1. **Every character of the body reaches a section.** Text before the first heading becomes a
 *      lead section rather than being skipped, and each section's body is the verbatim slice
 *      between its heading and the next. The only line not re-rendered is the heading itself,
 *      which becomes the section's label — so it is still on screen, once instead of twice.
 *   2. **A document this cannot read renders exactly as it did before.** `structured: false` is a
 *      supported, expected outcome, and the caller falls back to a single `<Markdown>`.
 *
 * Exports are unaffected either way: `AssetExportButtons` is handed `message.text`, which this
 * never mutates.
