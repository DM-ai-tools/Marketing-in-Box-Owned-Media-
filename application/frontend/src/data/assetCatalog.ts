 * several context keys — the CRO rewrite answers `cro`, `cro_rewritten_copy`, `cro_audit_findings`,
 * `cro_locked_sections` and `cro_terminology_map` — but `context_entries` holds one row per stage,
 * keyed by `asset_id` (see `save_stage` in `app/routers/pipeline.py`). So a field asking for
 * `cro_rewritten_copy` has to be turned into a request for `cro` before it can be fetched. In a live
 * session it never comes up, because the in-session store is keyed the field's way; it comes up the
 * moment context is read back — a resumed chat, or a Phase 2 run reading its parent Phase 1 run.
