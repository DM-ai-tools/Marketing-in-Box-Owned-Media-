/** The Phase 2 asset definitions, derived from the Phase 1 ones.
 *
 * Phase 2 builds the same kinds of asset one level down, for a single *sub-service* — Google Ads,
 * LinkedIn, Meta Ads — of the headline service Phase 1 covered. Its prompt files are, with two
 * exceptions, the Phase 1 prompt re-pointed at a sub-service: three are byte-identical to their
 * Phase 1 counterparts and three differ by a single INPUTS label. So the intake is derived from
 * Phase 1's with a declared delta rather than written out a second time. Hand-writing seven more
 * definitions would mean seven more field lists to keep in step with the prompts, and a field added
 * to a Phase 1 asset later would silently never reach its Phase 2 twin.
 *
 * The same delta shape exists on the backend (`PHASE2_OVERRIDES` in `app/services/generation.py`),
 * which owns the labels the prompts actually receive. `tests/test_phase2.py` pins that side; the
 * `relabel` entries here exist so the *question* an operator is asked matches the input it fills.
 *
 * What the delta covers:
 *   - `dropFields` — inputs the Phase 2 prompt file does not have. Asking them would collect
 *     answers with nowhere to go.
 *   - `relabel` — inputs it words differently, because it is asking about a sub-service.
 *   - `fromSubService` — inputs the sub-service itself answers, so they are not asked at all.
 *   - `gatherContext` — inputs that ask for a set of documents, not one.
 *   - `askOutright` — inputs Phase 2 must collect from the operator, never inherit.
 *   - `rewordHelp` — inputs that behave as they do in Phase 1 but must explain themselves
 *     differently, because the document behind them comes from somewhere else here.
 *   - which carried-over inputs stop to ask before being reused — see `askBeforeReusing` below.

 *
 * The distinction this draws is the one that decides whether an operator gets asked about a
 * carried-over input. A key in here was approved a few cards ago in this same run — re-asking
 * "do you want to use the pillar page you just approved?" is noise. Everything else a Phase 2 stage
 * reads is inherited from the parent Phase 1 run, which the operator may well want to override:
 * that is a document from another engagement, possibly months old, describing the headline service
 * rather than this sub-service.
