/** What the pipeline diagram should be doing on a chat that has just been reopened.

 * `activeStatus` is what drives every animation in `PipelineDiagram` — the breathing glow, the
 * rotating stage icon, the shimmering progress bar, the pulsing badge, the travelling connector.
 * Restoring it as `null` (which is what "no generation is streaming right now" literally means)
 * froze the whole flowchart on a resumed chat, even though the stage was very much still live and
 * waiting on the operator. So the state is re-derived from what the chat is actually waiting for,
 * exactly as the equivalent live session would have set it:
 *
 *   - a question or context choice outstanding -> `running` / "Awaiting Input", same as `beginMainIntake`
 *   - a draft or competitor listing to approve  -> `hitl`    / "Awaiting Review", same as `streamIntoMessage`
 *   - nothing outstanding                       -> `null`, and the resume banner offers the way on
 *
 * The scan runs newest-first because the last card that still wants something is the one the
 * operator is actually parked on.

  /** Point the workspace at the other phase, without leaving the chat.
   *
   * Phase 2 is the continuation of the Phase 1 engagement, not a separate errand: same client, same
   * operator, and the run it builds on is the one that was just walked. So the chat stays put — one
   * row in the sidebar, one client, both phases — and the switch is a move *within* it.
   *
   * What the operator sees, though, is a clear screen. Each phase keeps its own transcript (see
   * `messagesInPhase` and `GenerationStream`): Phase 2's opening question read at the bottom of
   * fifteen finished Phase 1 assets would be buried, and switching back has to show Phase 1 as it
   * was left, not as it was left plus somebody else's run.
   *
   * What cannot carry on is the phase-scoped half of the state. `currentIndex` is a position in one
   * phase's stage list (index 4 is Offers in Phase 1 and Blog in Phase 2), the two phases write to
   * different `runs` rows, and both produce assets under the same ids. That half is parked in
   * `phaseSlots` on the way out and restored on the way in, so switching back resumes where it left
   * off instead of restarting.
   *
   * Context is copied, not shared, into a Phase 2 leg that is starting fresh: Phase 2 should see
   * what Phase 1 produced — that is what its source run gives it anyway — but Phase 2's own
   * `pillar_page` must not overwrite Phase 1's in a chat the operator may switch back to.
   *
   * Before anything has been generated there is no cursor to park and no transcript to divide, so
   * the phase simply changes in place. */
