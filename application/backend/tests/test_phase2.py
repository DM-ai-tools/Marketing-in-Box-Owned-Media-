"""Tests for the Phase 2 pipeline's prompt wiring.

Phase 2 is expressed as a *delta* over Phase 1 rather than as a second set of prompt-and-schema
tables (see the Phase 2 section of `app/services/generation.py`). That is the right trade — one
field registry per asset cannot drift from itself — but it moves the risk somewhere new: a delta is
silent when it is wrong. A dropped field that no longer exists, a relabel whose field_id was renamed,
or a prompt file moved on disk all still *build a prompt*; they just build the wrong one, and the
first sign of it is a finished deliverable that answered the wrong question.

So what is pinned here is the delta actually landing: every Phase 2 stage resolves to a real file,
renders an INPUTS block, drops exactly what its prompt file has no input for, and relabels exactly
what its prompt file words differently. No network — nothing here calls Anthropic.
