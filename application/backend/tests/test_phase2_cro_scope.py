"""Phase 2's CRO stage writes about the *sub-service*, and never about the parent service.

The case this covers
--------------------
Phase 2 exists to build for one sub-service — Meta Ads — of the headline service Phase 1 covered —
Social Media Marketing. Its CRO stage is stage 01 and writes `cro_rewritten_copy`, and the Phase 2
Pillar Page prompt is a design replicator with no service input of any kind: it lays out whatever
copy it is handed. So the copy this stage writes *is* the subject of every page the phase produces.
If it comes back about Social Media Marketing, the whole run is about Social Media Marketing, and
nothing downstream can correct it — there is no later stage that knows what the page was meant to be.

The inputs alone do not prevent that. Three of the strategy inputs this stage receives are written
at the parent's scope by construction: the ICP Document is inherited from the parent Phase 1 run,
and Proof Assets Available and the outcome words in the terminology map come from that run's
`cro_client_settings`. Handed a parent-scope ICP and a one-line "Target Service or Sub-Service", a
model writes the page the bulk of its input describes. That is the same unfollowable-instruction
failure the design pipeline documents for colours: the fix is an explicit rule, not a better hope.

So the Phase 2 prompt file carries a **SCOPE LOCK** section that Phase 1's does not, and this file
pins it. It is the only thing standing between the two files: they were byte-identical before the
lock landed, and a well-meaning "sync the phase prompts" edit would restore that silently — the
stage would still build, still render its INPUTS, still produce a polished page, and the page would
be about the wrong service.

No network and no model call: the prompts are read off disk.
