"""Tests for the asset dependency graph — `app/services/dependencies.py`.

Why this file is worth its length
---------------------------------
The graph is what the two standalone-run routes answer from: "can `offers` run on this run" and
"what do I have to hand it if not". Every fact in it is derived from the draft schemas at import
time except two tables — `WRITES` and `PREPASS` — which are a second copy of information the
frontend's `assetCatalog.ts` also holds. A second copy that drifts is worse than no copy: readiness
would report a dependency as satisfiable by running an asset that does not write it, and the
operator would run that asset and be asked for the document anyway. So the drift tests at the top
parse the TypeScript and compare, and they are the reason keeping the copy is acceptable at all.

The rest pins the distinctions the dependency report is *for*, because each one is a wrong answer an
operator would act on:

  - a competitor prepass is not a dependency (it runs itself; there is no stage to run first),
  - `unresolved_context_key` is not a missing document (it is a question, asked every time),
  - a Phase 2 stage does not depend on a field Phase 2 drops,
  - and the "run these first" chain is short — one or two assets, not the whole pipeline.

No network and no database: everything here reads the schemas on disk.
