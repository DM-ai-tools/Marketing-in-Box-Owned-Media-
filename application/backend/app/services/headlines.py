"""Headline / topic suggestion, as a human-selectable gate in front of a stage's generation.

The pipeline already puts `COMPREHENSIVE_HEADLINE_FRAMEWORK.md` into eleven stages
(`REFERENCE_LIBRARY` in `app/services/generation.py`), where it constrains the titles a stage
writes inside its own deliverable. That is a *style* constraint on prose the operator never gets to
choose between: the Lead Magnet prompt, for instance, generates three to five candidate concepts,
scores them against its own rubric, declares its own winner, and builds that one. The four the
operator might have preferred are never shown.

This module is the other half. It produces a list of candidate headlines *before* a stage runs, as
structured data, so the operator picks one (or several) and the stage is then generated about the
thing they picked.

Three properties matter, and each is enforced somewhere specific rather than merely requested:

  Anchored.  Every candidate is about the service the run is for. Phase 1 anchors on the headline
             service ("Social Media Marketing"), Phase 2 on the sub-service ("Meta Ads"). The
             anchor is stated as a hard constraint in the prompt AND checked afterwards in
             `_ground_candidates`, because a prompt instruction is a request and a filter is not.

  Grounded.  Candidates are built from the run's own keyword cluster report — real primary
             keywords with real search volume and a real intent — not from what the model imagines
             people search for. A candidate naming a keyword outside the cleaned set is re-checked
             against `keywords.is_relevant`, exactly as `keywords.validate_clusters` re-checks an
             invented cluster term. Same gate, same reason.

  Framework-bound.  The framework is injected in full, and each candidate must *declare* how it
             used it: traffic temperature, formula family, which curiosity elements, and whether it
             passes the Part 11 pre-publication checklist. Declared structure is checkable;
             "follow the framework" is not.

Trend evidence comes from Claude's `web_search` tool, the same server tool `competitor.py` already
uses, scoped per asset (see `SLOTS`). It is what makes "viral / trendy" an observation rather than
an adjective the model applied to its own output.

#   2. **The run's target service.** Four of the eight gates (blog, webinar, podcast, pillar page)
#      have no service field of their own — worse, three of them sit at field index 0, so their gate
#      fires before any other answer exists. They inherit whatever service was named earlier in the
#      run, which is why the frontend files every `target_service_*` answer to a run-level fact.
#   3. **Phase 2's sub-service.** The one fact a Phase 2 leg is built around.

#      than a service. It was the *first* resort before this existed, which was the bug.
