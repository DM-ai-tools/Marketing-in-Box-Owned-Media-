"""Fetch a live web page and return its copy as readable, structure-preserving text.

Why this exists
---------------
The CRO stage's "Existing Page Content" input is the whole current page — per its own prompt file,
`[PASTE FULL COPY]`, which the audit then quotes line by line as evidence. Asking an operator to
produce that by hand is both the longest step in a run and the least reliable one: what actually
gets pasted is the visible prose, while accordion bodies, FAQ answers, button labels and footer
contact details — exactly the things Audits 1, 3 and 7 look for — are the parts people miss. The
stage already collects "Existing Page URL" one question earlier, so the page is one fetch away.

Two readers, tried in order
---------------------------
1. **Direct** — this backend's own HTTP fetch plus the extractor below. Fast, free, and right for
   the server-rendered marketing page this stage usually points at.
2. **Anthropic's `web_fetch` server tool** — used only when the direct read fails or comes back
   almost empty. That covers the two classes a plain GET can never handle: sites whose WAF refuses
   server-side clients outright (403 to every user agent — g2.com answers this backend with a 403
   and that fetcher with 24k characters), and sites that render their copy in the browser. No
   headless browser, no Chromium dependency; the page text is taken from the tool result rather
   than from anything the model writes, so nothing is paraphrased. Disable with
   `SCRAPER_CLAUDE_FALLBACK=0`.

`ScrapedPage.source` records which reader answered, and the UI says so. If both fail the operator
is asked to paste, with the direct read's reason shown — silent partial extraction is the one
outcome worth ruling out, because the CRO audit would then quote a page that isn't the client's.

Extraction shape
----------------
Text, not HTML — but headings keep their level as `#`/`##` markers, list items keep their bullet,
and `<button>`/submit labels are marked `[BUTTON] …`. The audit reasons about page *structure*
("Audit 5 — Architecture Gap Analysis" compares section order), so flattening everything into one
paragraph blob would throw away the input it needs. Built on `html.parser` from the stdlib rather
than adding a parsing dependency: the job is small, and its lenient handling of real-world markup
is the same reason BeautifulSoup defaults to it.
