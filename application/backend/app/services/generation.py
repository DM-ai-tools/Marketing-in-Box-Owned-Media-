"""Generic per-stage generation service for all 15 Phase 1 assets.

Generalizes the pattern `app/services/icp.py` established for the ICP stage: load the *real*
canonical master prompt for a stage from `assets/Prompts/`, reproduce that prompt's own
"fill in before submitting" INPUTS block from structured intake, and call Claude with the
unmodified instructions that follow — never a paraphrased summary of the prompt.

Source of the (asset_id -> prompt file) mapping and the (asset_id -> field schema file) mapping
is `schemas/drafts/DAG_SOURCE_MAP.md`. Field labels for each INPUTS block come from that same
asset's `schemas/drafts/<file>.json` (the authoritative field registry, not the frontend's
`assetCatalog.ts` — the two agree on `field_id`s but occasionally differ in cosmetic label
wording, and the schema JSON's label text is what actually matches each prompt file's own INPUTS
block variable names).

# 16k cap and truncate mid-deliverable (`stop_reason=max_tokens`), so they sit at 64k: the CRO
# rewrite alone emits a mode table, seven audits quoting the page as evidence, a complete rewritten
# page, and an implementation pack; the merged Pillar Page emits four parts including a built page.
#
# Do not lower these to save money — it does not work that way, and it silently ruins deliverables:
#
#   * `max_tokens` is a hard ceiling, not a target or a hint. Nothing is billed for headroom; you pay
#     for the tokens actually generated, so a 64k cap on a run that emits 9k costs exactly the same
#     as a 9k cap would. Lowering it does not reduce spend — it cuts the document off *after* you
#     have paid for everything up to the cut.
#   * The ceiling covers *thinking* as well as visible output, and adaptive thinking is on by
#     default on Sonnet 5. Measured: a small five-section page task capped at 1500 reported
#     `output_tokens=1500` with only ~3.1k characters of visible text — close to half the budget
#     went to reasoning that never reaches the document.
#
# To spend less, reduce what is *generated* rather than where it is truncated. That is what
# `effort` below is for. `generate_stage_stream` logs a WARNING naming the stage and the cap
# whenever one is hit.
#
# effort note: `output_config.effort` is the knob that actually lowers output spend, because
# thinking bills as output and adaptive thinking is on by default. Measured on this account, on
# the headline gate (`app/services/headlines.py`): the same prompt returned the same candidates in
# 4,464 output tokens at `low` where default effort spent 14,727 — a 70% cut. These stages write
# whole documents rather than naming ten headlines, so they sit at `medium` rather than `low`;
# `low` is reserved for the stages whose deliverable is short and templated. Raise a single stage
# by giving its config an explicit `effort=` rather than moving the default.

# Phase 2
#
# Phase 2 builds the same kinds of asset one level down, for a single *sub-service* (Google Ads,

# `assets/Prompts/Phase2/`, and its own seven-stage running order (see the frontend's
# `pipeline/pipelineData.ts`).
#
# Those files are overwhelmingly the Phase-1 prompt re-pointed at a sub-service: Lead Magnet, Blog
# and SMS are byte-identical to their Phase-1 counterparts, Funnel differs by one INPUTS label,
# Funnel Hub by one label, Content Marketing by one label. Only Pillar Page genuinely differs —
# Phase 2 uses the standalone v1.0 design prompt, which has no keyword/competitor-benchmark block,
# where Phase 1 uses the merged v2.0 that does.
#
# So a phase is expressed as a *delta* over the Phase-1 config rather than as a second full table.
# The alternative — a duplicate `<asset>_phase2.json` field registry per stage — would mean seven
# near-identical 20-field JSON files kept in sync by hand, and a Phase-1 field added later would
# silently fail to reach Phase 2. One registry per asset plus the delta below cannot drift that way,
# and the delta doubles as the documentation of what Phase 2 does not ask.

#

# every Title "MUST be derived from" it and to "consult it before writing a single Title" — while
# the file was never in context, so two of its six fallback rules were unfollowable: Rule 4 wants
# the Framework's per-channel character limits (Google Search 30, Facebook 25-40, title tag 50-60)
# and Rule 5 wants its pre-publication checklist, neither of which the prompt restates.
#
# Injected for the stages whose deliverable is substantially titles, topics or headlines, chosen
# from what each prompt's own output schema asks for — Offers writes a Title per rung, Lead Magnet a
# "Benefit-led name", Blog a Title (H1) it then checks against a 60-character budget, Podcast ten
# episode titles, Webinar a title and subtitle plus per-slide headlines. Stages that emit no

#
# The stages below build actual HTML that a client is expected to publish under their own brand.
# Every one of their prompts already forbids inventing a palette — the Pillar Page prompt states it
# as Rule 1, "No design invention. Every colour, button, layout, and visual element must trace back"
# — and until now none of them had anything to trace back *to*: the design reference reached the
# model through `scraper.py`, which strips every stylesheet and style attribute because its job is
# extracting copy.
#
# So the instruction was unfollowable and the model did the only thing it could, which was invent a
# plausible palette and present it as extracted. That failure is invisible in the output: a clean,
# professional lead magnet in the wrong brand's colours looks exactly like a correct one.
#
# `app/services/design_tokens.py` measures the real page instead. What it produces is injected here
# — beside the headline framework, through the same mechanism — so the values are in context before
# the master prompt tells the model to build.
