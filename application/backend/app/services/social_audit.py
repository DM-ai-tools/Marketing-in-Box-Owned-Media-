"""Turn one account's real, live social posts into the document Stage 10 asks for.

Why this exists
----------------
`social_content_strategy_audit.json`'s `raw_post_data_source` field accepts either an exported
CSV/XLSX or the instruction "research live via browser" — and the second of those is exactly the
invented-measurement failure this codebase keeps naming (`design_tokens.py` for a palette,
`image_briefs.py` for a photo): a model reading a scrape or a screenshot has no way to actually
count likes, so it guesses, and the guess is indistinguishable from a real number until someone
checks. `app/services/sociavault_client.py` is the real measurement; this module is what turns it
into the document the field's own instruction requires — real sample size and collection method
stated up front, never presented as a full archive.

What this module does not do
-----------------------------
It does not decide *what* to say about the posts — no scoring, no format/purpose classification,
no gap analysis. That is `Social-Content-Strategy-Audit-Architect-Prompt.md`'s job, working from
real data instead of an invented one. This module's only job is fetching and rendering that data.

    something SociaVault can look up. Almost every business site links to its own social profiles
    (a header icon, a footer, "follow us"), so reading those links off the page turns the domain

    unresolved, and only if Firecrawl is unconfigured or found nothing at all; it never overrides a
