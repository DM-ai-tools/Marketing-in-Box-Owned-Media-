"""Pull a page's real design system out of its CSS, so generated HTML looks like the client built it.

Every HTML-producing prompt in this pipeline already forbids inventing a palette. The Pillar Page
prompt is the strictest — it asks for the primary background, the brand colours, the text colours,
the border colours, exact button padding and radius, and then states as Rule 1: "No design
invention. Every colour, button, layout, and visual element must trace back" to the reference.

It was unfollowable. `reference_design_source` reaches the model through `scraper.py`, which
extracts *readable text* — it strips every tag, stylesheet and style attribute by design, because
its job is feeding copy to a CRO audit. So the model was told to trace every colour back to a
reference that contained no colours, and did the only thing it could: invent a plausible palette
and present it as extracted. That failure is invisible in the output — a clean, professional page
in the wrong brand's colours looks exactly like a correct one.

This module closes that gap with measurement rather than instruction. It fetches the page, fetches
the stylesheets the page links, and reads the values out:

  * **CSS custom properties first.** Any modern theme declares its palette once as `--brand-primary`
    and friends. That block *is* the design system, stated by the people who built it, and it beats
    any amount of frequency analysis over the rules that consume it.
  * **Then usage.** Colours are counted per role — what appears as a background, as text, as a
    border — because the same hex means different things in different properties, and a palette
    that does not say where each colour goes cannot be applied.
  * **Then components.** Button-ish selectors are read whole, so radius, padding and weight travel
    together with the colours instead of being reassembled by guesswork.

What it will not do is fill gaps. A page it cannot fetch yields `available=False` and a stated
reason, and the prompts fall back to asking the operator for hex codes. An empty result is honest
and recoverable; a fabricated one is neither.

# styled text/SVG if no logo file was supplied, matching the extracted brand mark style)." With no
# logo ever supplied, that fallback was the only branch that could ever run — so every generated
# asset carried a *recreated* wordmark, which is a drawing of a logo rather than the logo.
#
# Found rather than guessed, in confidence order, because pages disagree about where a logo lives:
# a header <img> whose markup says "logo" is nearly always right, an inline <svg> in the branding
# block is usually right, and a favicon is a last resort (it is the logo, cropped to 32px and often
# simplified).
#
# `og:image` is deliberately ranked last and usually rejected: it is a 1200x630 social share card,
# not a mark, and dropping one into a header renders a screenshot where a logo should be.
