"""Read a page's *skeleton* off its DOM, so a generated page can follow it instead of inventing one.

Why this exists
---------------
`design_tokens.py` argued that a prompt forbidding invented colours was unfollowable while the only
thing reaching the model was stripped text, and fixed it by measuring the CSS. `design_md.py` then
gave those measurements a schema. This module closes the same gap one level up, for *structure*.

The replica stages (`PAGE_REPLICA_STAGES` in `generation.py`) are told a visitor must not be able
to tell the generated page from the client's own. Until this existed, three things reached them and
none carried structure:

  * the page *text*, with every tag stripped — and `<nav>` and `<svg>` dropped outright by
    `scraper._DROP_CONTENT_TAGS`, so the menu, the logo's placement and every inline icon were
    already gone before the model saw anything;
  * `DESIGN.md`, which is a style sheet — it says buttons have a 30px radius and says nothing
    about there being nine sections in a particular order;
  * two screenshots, of which the full-page one is usually withheld, because a real landing page's
    full-height shot measured 1920x17615 and Anthropic rejects anything past 8000px
    (`context_dev.Screenshot.model_safe`). So in practice the model sees the top 900 pixels and
    guesses the rest of the page.

Asked to reproduce a page it has never seen below the fold, a model does the only thing it can: it
invents a plausible section order and presents it as a replica. That failure is invisible in the
output — a clean page in the wrong section order looks exactly like a correct one.

So: measurement again, not instruction. The DOM says how many bands there are, what order they run
in, which one holds the h1, where the logo sits relative to the nav, which images are the client
logo strip, what the phone number is and which bands repeat it, how many inline SVGs there are and
what they are, and what every heading says. All of it is free — no Context.dev credits — because
the HTML was already fetched to read the CSS.

What this is not
----------------
It is a *description*, not a template. It tells the model the sequence to follow and the details to
carry over verbatim; the model still writes the HTML, so the geometry is still generated and can
still drift. `page_replica.py` is the answer to that — it transports the real markup and swaps only
the words. This module remains useful even so, and is not scaffolding for that one:

  * it is the fallback whenever a replica capture is impossible or declined (a page too big to
    template, a reference on a domain that is not the client's);
  * it is what makes the *screenshot* and *token* views legible — a band list with roles is how the
    model knows which of the nine sections the hero shot is showing;
  * it is what an operator reads to check the capture understood the page at all.

Every field is either read off the DOM or absent. Nothing here is inferred to fill a gap, for the
reason `design_tokens.py` states about palettes and this module inherits about layout.
