"""Account, credential, and session mechanics for the sign-in gate.

Email and password only. There is no federated/OAuth sign-in: an account is an email plus a
scrypt-hashed password in this project's own Postgres, and nothing here talks to a third party.

Everything security-sensitive about authentication lives in this module so there is exactly one
place to audit; `app/routers/auth.py` above it does request/response shaping and cookie plumbing
only.

Two deliberate choices, each of which removes a dependency rather than adding one:

1. **Password hashing is stdlib `hashlib.scrypt`**, not bcrypt/argon2 via passlib. scrypt is a
   memory-hard KDF standardised in RFC 7914 and shipped in CPython, so the project gains a
   correct password hash without a new wheel to install, pin, or rebuild on deploy. Parameters
   are stored *inside* each hash string, so they can be raised later without invalidating
   existing passwords — `verify_password` reads the cost from the stored value, not from the
   constants below.

2. **Sessions are opaque random tokens in a database row**, not JWTs. See the `UserSession`
   docstring in app/db/models.py: sign-out has to actually revoke, which a stateless token
   cannot do.
