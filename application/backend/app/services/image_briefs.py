"""Brand-aware image briefs for HTML-producing assets, and the image-generation calls that fulfil them.

Why generation happens here and not in the model's own prompt
----------------------------------------------------------------
A brief used to be handed to the model as an instruction — "generate this with Runway, then place
the returned URL in the HTML" — inside the HTML-producing stage's own prompt. That call has no tool
access to an image generator, so the instruction was unfollowable: the model could only fabricate a
plausible-looking URL, exactly the failure `design_tokens.py` documents for an invented palette,
one layer up. `generate_all` is the fix — the same shape as that fix, too: measure first, then hand
the model the real, already-resolved value, never an instruction to produce one itself.

Runway -> OpenAI
----------------
Originally wired to Runway, which hosts the image it generates and returns a URL. OpenAI's image
models return base64 bytes instead (confirmed against OpenAI's own docs before switching:
`response_format=url` is DALL-E-only), so `generate_all` now does one more step than it used to —
`media_storage.save_generated_image` stages those bytes as a `MediaAsset` row and returns the URL
this backend serves them back at. See that module's docstring for why a data URI is not the fix,
and why the bytes land in Postgres rather than on local disk (this app deploys to Railway, where
local disk is the container's own ephemeral disk).

    Generation order, per brief
    ----------------------------
    1. If the brief carries `reference_image_urls`, try OpenAI's reference-grounded edit
       (`openai_image_client.edit_image`) — the image is built from the client's own real
       photographs, not invented from a text description alone. See that function's docstring.
    2. Otherwise, or if step 1 failed (a reference URL that no longer resolves, a content-policy
       rejection), try plain OpenAI generation (`openai_image_client.generate_image`).
    3. If OpenAI fails entirely *and* `RUNWAYML_API_SECRET` is set, retry with Runway
       (`runway_image_client.generate_image`). Runway is transparent to the rest of the pipeline:
       it returns the same `GeneratedImageBytes` type. Runway has no edit equivalent wired here, so
       a reference-grounded brief that falls through to Runway loses the grounding, not the image.
    4. If everything fails, the brief is skipped and a note is appended.

    The generation calls are issued concurrently per brief, like the two Context.dev screenshots in
    `design_md.capture_page_design`. Saving to Postgres happens *after* that gather, one at a time
    — an `AsyncSession` is not safe for concurrent use across coroutines.

    `notes` carries one line per failure for the caller to fold into the run's own notes.

    Returns `((), ())` immediately when neither provider is configured.
