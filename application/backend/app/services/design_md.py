"""Turn the client's live page into a DESIGN.md, so a generated page can be built from measurements.

Why this exists
---------------
`design_tokens.py` already argues the case: every HTML-producing prompt in this pipeline forbids
inventing a palette, and until that module existed the prompts were unfollowable because the only
thing reaching the model was stripped text. This module is the next step of the same argument.

Two things were still missing.

**A schema.** `tokens_to_markdown` emits prose tables — readable, but every consumer re-reads them
as English and there is no name for "the brand colour" that a build can reference. DESIGN.md is a
published format (YAML token front matter + human rationale) with a token vocabulary, so a value
extracted here has a name the generated CSS can carry, and the same file drops into a linter or a
Tailwind theme without a translation pass. Spec: `.claude/skills/design-spec/SKILL.md`.

**Computed styles.** The CSS parse in `design_tokens.py` is a regex over stylesheets. It cannot
resolve the cascade, so a heading font set four sheets deep, behind a `var()` chain, or inside a
media query is invisible to it. Context.dev's `/web/styleguide` reports what the browser actually
computed. That is the difference between a plausible palette and the real one.

How the two are merged
----------------------
Context.dev is primary and the local parse fills what it has no field for:

| From `/web/styleguide` + `/web/fonts` | From the local CSS parse |
| --- | --- |
| colors (accent / background / text)   | the real logo (inline SVG or data URI) |
| the h1-h4 + p type scale              | palette *usage roles* — which hex is a border, which is a surface |
| spacing and shadow scales             | button hover states |
| button and card component styles      | the site's own `--custom-property` names |
| webfont families and their file URLs  | |

Neither is asked to cover for the other. When Context.dev is unavailable the local parse still
produces a DESIGN.md on its own (thinner, and it says so); when both fail, `available=False` and a
stated reason — never a plausible invented palette, which is the one output that looks correct to
everybody except the client.

A third tier, for named gaps only
----------------------------------
Context.dev stays primary — this is not a reordering. `_brand_gaps` checks, after the two sources
above have answered, whether colours, a type scale, or a logo are still missing (a bot-walled
page, a JS theme the local parse cannot resolve). Only for gaps that are actually still open,
`_capture_brand_fallback` tries Firecrawl's structured extraction (`app/services/firecrawl_client.py`)
and then Brandfetch's brand-by-domain lookup (`app/services/brandfetch_client.py`), each filling
only the keys the one before it left empty. Neither ever overrides a value Context.dev or the
local parse already found — see `BrandFallback` and the `fallback` argument threaded through
`_color_tokens`, `_typography_tokens` and `_logo_lines` below.

Screenshots
-----------
A token sheet describes a palette. It does not describe a layout: section order, hero composition,
how much air sits between bands. Two shots are captured (2 credits) — a full-page one for structure
and an above-the-fold one at readable resolution — and handed to the CRO rewrite as image blocks.
See `Screenshot.model_safe`: a full-page shot of a long page exceeds what Anthropic accepts, and is
then kept for the operator but withheld from the prompt.

Two views out
-------------
* `design_md` — everything. For the CRO Page Rewrite, which is reproducing the page.
* `theme_brief` — colours, type, shapes and the logo, with the layout, spacing and component blocks
  removed. For lead magnets, which must look like the same brand without being a copy of the
  client's landing page.
