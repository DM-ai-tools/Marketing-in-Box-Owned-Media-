"""Competitor-analysis prepass stages — the 10 `competitor_analysis_*` assets.

These are the auxiliary stages that must run *before* their paired main asset, so the main
asset's prompt receives a real competitor benchmark instead of a placeholder. Per
`schemas/drafts/DAG_SOURCE_MAP.md` and `scripts/seed_asset_definitions.py`, 10 of the 15 main
Phase-1 assets declare a `competitor_analysis_*` stage in their `depends_on` edges; the other
5 (icp, funnel, funnel_hub_media, sms_sequence, plan_of_action) have none. `pillar_page` is one of
the 10 since the former `seo_pillar_page` variant stage was merged into it.

Two things make these stages structurally different from the 15 main ones in
`app/services/generation.py`, which is why they live in their own module rather than as more
rows in `STAGE_CONFIGS`:

1. **Prompt shape.** Main prompts carry a "— INPUTS (fill in before submitting) —" block
   followed by a `# — MASTER PROMPT (do not edit below this line) —` marker, so
   `generation.build_prompt` rebuilds the INPUTS block and splices on everything after the
   marker. The competitor files have no marker and no INPUTS block: the whole file *is* the
   prompt, with `{TARGET_URL}` / `{NICHE}` / `{LOCATION}` / `{SERVICE}` placeholders
   substituted in place (verified across all 10 files; `01_CRO.md` and
   `07_Social_Content_Strategy_and_Posts.md` hardcode their service and so have no
   `{SERVICE}`).

2. **Tool use.** Each file explicitly requires verifying candidates by fetching the actual page
   ("do not rely on titles or search snippets alone"). Without a real search tool Claude can
   only produce plausible-looking domains from training memory, which would then silently
   corrupt every downstream asset that reads the competitor context key. These calls therefore
   run with Anthropic's server-side `web_search` tool by default — see `_web_search_enabled`.

# Per `seed_asset_definitions.py`, every competitor stage is model_tier=sonnet: this work needs
# real verification reasoning (confirming a competitor is a genuine service provider, not a
# directory or aggregator) rather than cheap pattern-matching.
#
# `COMPETITOR_MODEL` overrides it, for measuring that claim rather than restating it — the argument
# for Sonnet here is a judgement about a task, and a judgement about a task is testable.
#
# It is also, on this stage specifically, the biggest cost lever there is. Priced from the 22
# measured prepasses recorded at `_DEFAULT_SEARCH_BUDGET` below (276,465 input, 8,141 output, 10.5
# searches, $0.739/call — which reproduces exactly at Sonnet 5's $2/$10):
#
#   Sonnet 5     input $0.553 (75%)   output $0.081 (11%)   search $0.105 (14%)   = $0.739
#   Haiku 4.5    input $0.276 (65%)   output $0.041 (10%)   search $0.105 (25%)   = $0.422
#
# A 43% cut, because this call is *input*-dominated — the server-side tool loop re-reads the prompt
# and every result gathered so far on each iteration — and Haiku 4.5 halves the input rate. That is
# a much larger effect than `effort` can reach here (see `_effort`), which is the reverse of the
# ordering that holds on the headline gate, where output dominates. Cost profile, not model tier,
# is what decides which lever pays.
#
# So why is Sonnet still the default? Because the risk is not symmetrical either. This stage decides
# whether a domain is a genuine service provider or a directory dressed as one, and a wrong verdict
# does not raise — it writes a plausible-looking competitor into the context key that ten
# downstream assets read. $0.32 a call is worth paying until an A/B on real runs says it is not,
# which is what this switch exists to make possible.
#
# Whatever it is set to is what gets *billed*, so it is also what gets recorded: the usage row is
# stamped with the resolved model, not with `SONNET`.

# Sonnet 5's ceiling is 128k output tokens; 16k is generous headroom for a 10-row JSON array plus
# the notes section each prompt asks for, without risking the mid-array truncation that would make
# the output unparseable.
_MAX_TOKENS = 16000

# `output_config.effort`, which this call previously did not send at all — so it ran at the API
# default of `high`, the most expensive setting, by omission rather than by decision. Worth fixing,
# but worth being honest about the size of: on the measured split above, output is 11% of this
# call, so even the 70% output cut `headlines.py` measured at `low` (4,464 tokens against 14,727 at
# the default) is about 8% of the bill here. Effort is a real saving on a small share; the input
# side is where this stage's money is, and `_DEFAULT_SEARCH_BUDGET` owns that.
#
# There is a second, unmeasured path by which it may reach the big number: lower effort means fewer
# and more consolidated tool calls, and iterations are exactly what drive the input total. If that
# holds here it would matter more than the output saving — which is a reason to compare `medium`
# against `none` on `api_usage` rather than to assume either way.
#
# `medium` rather than `low`, deliberately. The stage's job is discrimination and its failures are
# silent, so this is not a place to buy the last 3% by thinking less. `low` is for stages whose
# deliverable is short and templated. `COMPETITOR_EFFORT` moves it; `none` sends no `output_config`
# at all, which is the setting to measure against.

# Deliberately the basic `web_search_20250305`, not the newer `web_search_20260209` that Sonnet 5
# also supports. `_20260209` adds dynamic filtering (it runs code execution internally to filter
# results before they reach the context window), which is a real quality/token win in general — but
# it is markedly slower, and this prepass BLOCKS the stage the operator is waiting on. Measured on
# this workload: `_20250305` completes a competitor stage in ~60-80s; `_20260209` did not finish a
# comparable prompt inside 7 minutes. The basic tool already returns verified, real competitors
# here, so the latency is not worth trading. Revisit if the prepass ever moves off the critical
# path (e.g. runs ahead of time as its own queued job).
#
# `max_uses` is the search budget for one stage, and it is the single most expensive number in this
# repo. 8 was tuned when every competitor stage was an invisible prepass the operator was blocked
# on; it was raised to 12 because finding *ten* competitors that each maintain a genuine pillar page
# on one topic — and opening each candidate to confirm it is a cornerstone page rather than a thin
# service page — is several searches per keeper.
#
# What that raise actually cost, measured from `api_usage` over 22 real prepasses at `max_uses: 12`:
#
#   avg input 276,465 tokens/call   avg output 8,141   avg 10.5 searches   avg $0.739/call
#
# 276k input tokens against a ~1,500-token prompt file is not a bug — it is how a server-side tool
# loop bills. Each of the ~11 internal iterations re-reads the prompt plus every result gathered so
# far, so input grows with the square of the budget while the deliverable (a 10-row array) does not
# grow at all. Those 22 calls were $16.27 of a $45.47 bill: 36% of total spend, on the stage with
# the smallest output in the pipeline.
#
# Back to 8, which is a value this pipeline already ran in production rather than a guess, and
# env-tunable so the tradeoff can be measured instead of argued about. Note what does *not* work
# here: a `cache_control` breakpoint. The iterations happen inside one `messages.create`, so there
# is no second request whose prefix could hit a cache — the only lever on this cost is how many
# times the loop goes round.

# Their prompt files live in `Competitor Analysis/../Phase2/competitors_phase2/` and are the Phase-1
# files re-pointed at a sub-service — `03_Lead_Magnet_phase2.md` is byte-identical to Phase 1's, and

# search returns competitors doing *Google Ads* lead magnets rather than competitors doing marketing
# lead magnets. It reaches `resolve_inputs` through the run-level client profile's `sub_service`.

# All three are gated: each one is reviewed before the stage it feeds runs, because a sub-service
# competitor set is exactly the thing an operator needs to read before choosing a blog topic or
