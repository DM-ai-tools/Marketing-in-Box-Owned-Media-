"""The one place this backend talks to Firecrawl.

Why this exists
----------------
Context.dev is, and stays, the primary source for `DESIGN.md` (see `app/services/design_md.py`
and the "One API and one key for web data" rule in `CLAUDE.md`). This module has two jobs, on two
different triggers.

**`extract_brand_tokens`** is the narrow, secondary one: when Context.dev's `/web/styleguide` and
`/web/fonts` and the free local CSS parse in `design_tokens.py` *all* leave a field unfilled — a
bot-walled page, a JS-heavy theme the local parse cannot resolve — Firecrawl's structured extraction
is tried before giving up on that field. It is never called unless `design_md._brand_gaps` finds
something missing, and it never overrides a value Context.dev or the local parse already found. See
`design_md._capture_brand_fallback`.

**`extract_reference_images`** has no equivalent gap to wait for: there is no free local reader for
"what does this business actually look like", and a generated image with nothing to go on but brand
colours is exactly how this pipeline used to produce photorealistic images of the wrong subject
(see its own docstring, and `image_briefs.py`). It runs once per run, alongside the brand-token
capture, whenever Firecrawl is configured and image generation is about to happen.

What this module returns
-------------------------
`extract_brand_tokens` asks Firecrawl's `/extract` for a fixed JSON Schema (colors, fonts, logo,
button radius) rather than scraping HTML and re-parsing it here — that would just be a second,
worse copy of `design_tokens.py`. The values come back as raw strings; validation (is this really
a hex colour?) happens in `design_md.py`'s merge, the same place that already validates
Context.dev's own colours, so there is exactly one place a bad value gets caught.

`/extract` is asynchronous: POST returns a job id, and the result is polled from
`GET /extract/{id}`. `_poll` bounds that with `_MAX_POLL_SECONDS` rather than waiting forever on a
job that never finishes.

Testing
-------
Tests must not reach the live API. Patch the functions in this module — never `_client()`.

    do not reflect the client's real product, people or premises. Handing the model real photographs
    from the client's own page (via `openai_image_client.edit_image`) grounds the generated image in
    the actual subject matter instead of an invented one — the same fix `DESIGN.md`'s palette
    measurement is for colour, one layer up.

    Unlike `extract_brand_tokens`, this is not gated on a "gap" — there is no free local reader for
    "what does this business look like", so it is called whenever image generation is about to run
