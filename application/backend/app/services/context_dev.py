"""The one place this backend talks to Context.dev.

Why a gateway module
--------------------
Context.dev is a single key over a wide surface — scraping, web search, brand intelligence,
structured extraction — and three different stages of this pipeline want three different pieces of
it. Scattering `AsyncContextDev()` construction across `scraper.py`, the competitor service and the
design-token service would mean three places that each have to remember the credit cost, the
cache-age rule, and the fact that a missing key is a configuration problem rather than a page
problem. So every call goes through here, and the callers get plain dataclasses back instead of SDK
response models.

What the app uses it for
------------------------
* **`scrape_markdown`** — `GET /web/scrape/markdown`, 1 credit. Reader #2 behind
  `app/services/scraper.py`: the CRO stage needs the *whole* live page (accordions, FAQ bodies,
  button labels) and a plain server-side GET loses that on any site that renders in the browser or
  whose WAF refuses non-browser clients. This endpoint egresses from Context.dev's own fleet and
  returns rendered, LLM-ready Markdown, which is precisely the shape the audit prompt wants.
* **`search`** — `POST /web/search`, 1 credit per 10 results. Grounded source discovery for the
  competitor and ICP stages: ranked results with the page copy already in Markdown, so a
  competitor analysis can quote a live page instead of a model's recollection of one.
* **`retrieve_brand`** — `POST /brand/retrieve`, 10 credits. Resolves a domain to the brand record
  (title, description, slogan, colors, logos, socials, industry classification). The ICP and
  design-token stages both currently reconstruct parts of this from raw HTML.
* **`extract_styleguide`** — `GET /web/styleguide`, 10 credits. The full design system for a URL:
  colors, the h1-h4/p type scale, a spacing scale, shadows, and button/card component styles. This
  is the backbone of the per-run `DESIGN.md` (see `app/services/design_md.py`).
* **`extract_fonts`** — `GET /web/fonts`, 5 credits. Which typefaces the page actually uses and how
  much of it each one sets, plus the webfont files to link. The styleguide names a family per
  heading level; this says which family is *the* body face.
* **`screenshot`** — `GET /web/screenshot`, 1 credit. What the page looks like. Fed to the CRO
  rewrite as an image alongside the tokens, because a token sheet describes a palette but not a
  layout — section order, hero composition and how much air sits between bands are things a model
  can only match by seeing them.
* **`extract_structured`** — `POST /web/extract`, 10 credits. A URL plus this project's own JSON
  Schema, for the stages that want fields rather than prose.

Credits, caching, and retries
-----------------------------
Every call costs money, so: nothing here loops over URLs (use `POST /batch/submit` past a few
hundred), and the default is Context.dev's cached result. `max_age_ms` is passed only when a caller
explicitly asks for fresh data — `FRESH_*` below name the two ages this app actually wants.

Retries are the SDK's: it honours `Retry-After` on 429, backs off exponentially with jitter on
408/409/5xx, and does not retry validation errors. `_MAX_RETRIES` sets the bound.

Testing
-------
Tests must not reach the live API. Patch the functions in this module (they are the seam that
exists for it) — never `_client()`. See `tests/test_context_dev.py`.
