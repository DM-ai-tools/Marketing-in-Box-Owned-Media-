"""Which assets an asset needs before it can run, and which of those a run already has.

Why this exists
---------------
The pipeline was built to run in order: fifteen stages, each reading the approved output of the ones
before it. That is the right default and it is not the only way an operator wants to work. A client
who already has a value ladder wants the Offers stage skipped; a client who wants only a Plan of
Action should not have to pass through thirteen stages to reach it.

The dependency information to support that already existed but was scatt: `context_key`, `required`
and `fallback` live in `schemas/drafts/*.json`, while which asset *writes* each key lived only in
the frontend's `assetCatalog.ts`. Nothing on the server could answer "what does `offers` actually
need". This module answers it, so the two routes that make standalone runs possible —
`POST /runs/{id}/context` to seed a dependency and `GET /runs/{id}/readiness/{asset}` to report on
them — have one source of truth rather than a hand-maintained list each.

The shape of the answer, from `docs/Asset_Dependency_Map.md`
-----------------------------------------------------------
Only four assets are ever a hard prerequisite for another: `icp` (needed by eleven), `cro` (its
rewrite feeds six), `pillar_page` (its `design_tokens` feeds three) and `funnel`/`webinar` (one
each). Everything else is a leaf. So most "skip to stage N" requests need one or two upstream
documents, not a rebuild of the whole run.

What is *not* a dependency
--------------------------
The ten `competitor_analysis_*` prepasses. Each runs itself inside its paired stage and does its own
web search, so a stage with a prepass needs no upstream asset for it — see `prepass_for`. They are
reported separately from dependencies for exactly that reason: telling an operator that `offers`
"requires a competitor analysis" would send them looking for a stage to run first, when the answer
is that it happens on its own.
