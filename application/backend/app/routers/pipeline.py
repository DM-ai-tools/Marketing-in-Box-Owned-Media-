"""Routes for the Phase 1 pipeline UI.

Phases: every generation/competitor route takes a `phase` ("phase1" | "phase2"). It selects the
prompt file and INPUTS block for the stage (see app/services/generation.py) and, for competitor
stages, which market the search is run against. A Phase 2 run is created with `source_run_id` set to
the Phase 1 run it builds on, and inherits that run's approved context.

Persistence (Postgres):
  - POST /pipeline/runs                          bootstrap a Client + Run for one browser session,
                                                  or a linked sub-service run over an existing one
  - GET  /pipeline/source-runs                   runs a Phase 2 run could inherit context from
  - POST /pipeline/runs/{run_id}/stages/{asset_id}/save
                                                  persist a stage's approved output as a new
                                                  ContextEntry version, advance its RunStage to
                                                  APPROVED, and record the approval in the audit log

Standalone runs (skip to a stage without running the ones before it — see
docs/Asset_Dependency_Map.md):
  - GET  /pipeline/runs/{run_id}/readiness/{asset_id}
                                                  which of a stage's upstream documents this run
                                                  already has, which are missing, and what would
                                                  have to run to fill them (free, read-only)
  - POST /pipeline/runs/{run_id}/context          file a document under a context key by hand, so a
                                                  stage can run without its producer

Intake helper:
  - POST /pipeline/design                        capture a page's DESIGN.md + screenshots (17 credits)
  - GET  /pipeline/runs/{run_id}/design          the DESIGN.md already captured for a run (free)
  - POST /pipeline/scrape                        read a live page and return its copy as text, so
                                                  the operator does not paste a whole page by hand

Generation (Anthropic, real per-stage master prompts — see app/services/generation.py):
  - POST /pipeline/generate/{asset_id}/stream    stream a stage's real generation from its
                                                  intake answers
  - POST /pipeline/refine/{asset_id}/stream      stream a revision of a previous draft per an
                                                  operator's requested change
  - POST /pipeline/competitor-briefing/{asset_id}
                                                  summarise an approved competitor listing for the
                                                  operator before that stage's own intake

No context-resolution/read side or rejection/edit flow beyond what's listed above.

    is what the "start at this stage" gate is built on: for each missing dependency the operator gets
    the same three options, and the fields here are what decide which of them are even offered.

      - **use what is there** — `ready` is true. `source`, `from_run_id` and `seeded` say where it
        came from, because "the ICP from the parent run" and "an ICP approved in this run" are not
        the same offer.
      - **provide it yourself** — always available for a key in `seedable`; the only option when
        `producer` is null (`email_sequence_copy`, which `sms_sequence` reads and no asset writes).
      - **run the producer first** — `run_first` in dependency order, already filtered to what is
        actually missing.

    Inheritance is honoured throughout: a Phase 2 run reading its Phase 1 parent's ICP is ready, not
    blocked. `PHASE_SCOPED_CONTEXT_KEYS` still does not cross the boundary.

              - the context key itself — which is where a hand-seeded document lands, and
