    200 — which reads as a broken feature rather than a missing seed. The upsert is idempotent
    (see app/db/seed.py), so paying it once per boot is cheaper than the class of bug it removes.

    Deliberately non-fatal: if the database is unreachable at startup, the app should still come up
    and answer `/health` rather than crash-loop the deployment. The routes that need the DB will
    fail on their own terms, and the log line below says exactly how to apply the seed by hand.

    Also deliberately time-boxed. psycopg's own connect timeout is ~2 minutes, and nothing binds the
    port until this returns — long enough for a platform health check to fail the deploy over a
    database blip. `SEED_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is far more than a reachable database needs and far less
