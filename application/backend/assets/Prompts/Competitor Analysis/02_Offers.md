# Competitor Analysis Prompt — Offers (Best Published Pricing/Packages)

Find UP TO 10 direct competitors in the {LOCATION} market for the company: {TARGET_URL},
using the optional targeting inputs below to control how narrow/broad the competitor set should be.
If fewer than 10 genuinely qualifying competitors can be found and verified, return fewer rather
than padding the list with weak or unverified matches — flag any lower-confidence entries instead
of silently including them.

Additional inputs (all optional unless stated):

competitor_type:
  "niche_specialist" = a company specialised in the target's core service/industry
  "full_stack_niche" = a full-service company in the same industry prominently offering the
  target service with a clear packaged offer
  If missing or empty, include both types.

service: {SERVICE} — the specific service/product the target sells (inferred from {TARGET_URL}
if not specified).
  (Only include companies with a clearly published, comparable OFFER for this service — a
  dedicated packages/pricing page with visible tiers, a stated starting price, or itemised
  inclusions. Vague "contact us for a quote" pages without any published packaging should be
  deprioritised or excluded in favour of companies with transparent, structured offers.)

niche: {NICHE} — leave open if not specified (no industry restriction beyond matching the
target's core service).

location: {LOCATION}, if not specified analyze it from {TARGET_URL}, boosting local leaders if provided.

excluded_competitors: [list any domains already sourced in prior runs]

Competitor Selection Logic:
- Find {LOCATION} companies that offer the target's core service AND publish a clear, comparable
  offer (tiered packages, starting price, itemised deliverables, add-ons)
- Apply competitor_type and niche filtering if provided
- Exclude generalists with no real offer structure (vague service blurbs with no packaging or
  pricing signal)
- MUST have strong organic visibility (ranking pages, consistent SEO presence)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ONLY include high-quality competitors with strong organic traffic/SEO presence in Australia
- Prefer companies that: publish transparent pricing/package tiers, itemise deliverables, and
  show credible client results or reviews
- Exclude: directories, marketplaces, freelancer platforms, low-quality or inactive sites, and
  aggregators

Ranking & Scoring Guidance:
similarity_score (0–1) should reflect:
- Offer clarity/strength (highest weight — tiered pricing, itemised inclusions, add-ons)
- Service and niche match
- Business model similarity
- Geographic relevance (boost if location provided)
- Organic search competitiveness overlap with the target

Output Requirements (STRICT):
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "competitors": [
    {
      "domain": "competitor1.com.au",
      "name": "Competitor Inc",
      "offer_page_url": "https://competitor1.com.au/packages/",
      "starting_price": "From $1,500/mo",
      "verification_confidence": "Verified",
      "offering_summary": "Three published tiers (Starter / Growth / Scale) at $1,500, $3,200 and $6,500 per month, each itemising content volume, ad spend managed and reporting cadence. Setup fee $990, waived on annual. Add-ons for video and landing pages priced separately.",
      "similarity_score": 0.92,
      "avg_position": 12.5,
      "intersections": 450
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Returned 6 of 10. Four otherwise-strong candidates were excluded for publishing no packaging at all (quote-only enquiry forms): agencyx.com.au, agencyy.com.au and two DesignRush listings. One near-miss, agencyz.com.au, shows tiers but no price of any kind, so it was included at reduced confidence rather than dropped."
}

Field rules:
- `offer_page_url` — the page where the offer is actually published (a packages, pricing or plans
  page). Not the homepage and not a generic service page: this is the page the value-ladder stage
  benchmarks against, so it has to be the one a buyer would compare.
- `starting_price` — the lowest published price, with its unit and any "from" qualifier kept:
  "From $1,500/mo", "$990 setup + $2,400/mo", "$4,500 one-off". Use null only when no price of any
  kind is published — never estimate one, and never convert currencies. An invented price would flow
  straight into this client's own pricing decisions.
  **Leave tax out of this field.** Report the figure the page states without any GST / VAT / sales-tax
  qualifier: a page advertising "$1,490 + GST per month" is reported as "From $1,490/mo". This field
  is a column operators scan down to compare offers, and tax notation makes near-identical prices
  look different. Do NOT do the arithmetic either way — never gross a price up to include tax, and
  never strip tax out of a tax-inclusive figure to derive a lower one; both would be invented
  numbers. Where the page states a tax basis, say so in `offering_summary` instead ("priced ex-GST",
  "$1,639/mo inc GST"), so the comparison stays honest without cluttering the price.
- `offering_summary` — one or two sentences describing the **shape of the offer**: how many tiers,
  what each costs, what is itemised inside them, setup fees, contract minimums, and priced add-ons.
  Base it only on what the page states. This is what a reader sees next to the competitor, so it
  must stand on its own without the URL being opened.
- `verification_confidence` — exactly one of "Verified", "Partially verified", or "Unverified",
  reflecting whether the published offer and its price were confirmed on the page itself.
- `avg_position` / `intersections` — use null when unavailable.
- `notes` — required, always present even when 10 results are returned. State how many were returned
  against the requested 10, explain any gap, and name near-misses or false positives that were
  excluded and why (quote-only pages, directories, aggregators, no packaging). Write it as prose for
  a human reader, not as a data structure.

Do NOT include any explanation, markdown, or extra text outside the JSON object itself. The
competitor listing (each competitor with its offer/packages page URL, starting price, verification
confidence, and offer summary) and the notes section are rendered from this object for an operator
to approve — so every field above must be populated rather than described elsewhere in prose.
